# Benson’s Trail Guide

There are few people who know the Domain’s more than 50 miles of trails as well as Sewanee Outing Program Director John Benson, so we asked him to put together this guide to 10 of his favorite hikes, ranging in length from one mile to 20 miles.


## The Cross / Tennessee Williams Trail

miles: 1.25

route: loop

directions: Start at the Cross. Facing the valley, head left, follow- ing the Perimeter Trail, being careful to follow the blue blazes. You’ll cross over the old road to the Cross and then turn left on a fire lane. This will take you back to the Tennessee Williams Trail, which parallels the portion of Tennessee Ave. from the soccer field to the Cross. Take another left on this trail and follow it back to the Cross.

description: This largely overlooked and shady section of trail offers an easy and relaxing hike through rolling topography. Remarkable features include a spot where the trail narrows through a split in a huge sandstone block and an easy stream crossing thanks to two perfectly placed flat rocks.  On the first section of this hike, the trail will take you directly over a boulder that displays a geometric design of Liesegang banding. The pattern looks manmade; it’s not. Liesegang banding is formed by iron deposits from water seep- ing through sandstone and is responsible for many elaborate designs found in the sandstone cliffs around Sewanee.


## Morgan’s Steep to the Cross

miles: 1

route: one way

directions: Start at Morgan’s Steep. Facing the valley, head down the stairs you’ll find to the left and follow the blue blazes to the Memorial Cross and University View.  

description: It’s the most frequently hiked section of the Perimeter Trail, and for good reason: This one-mile stretch has it all — gorgeous overlooks, waterfalls, sandstone overhangs and even a stone tunnel. Most of the trail runs just below the bluff, but it starts and ends at two of the best views on the Domain — Morgan’s Steep and Uni- versity View — with a bonus overlook if you scramble up to the top of Proctor’s Hall. The tunnel through Proctor’s Hall is reason enough to make the hike, inscribed with names carved over 100 years ago. This trail, as well as the one through Shakerag Hollow, was constructed by the Civilian Conserva- tion Corps in the 1930s. Take a moment to admire the CCC’s impressive stone steps up the hill from the stream crossing.  Walking this section at dusk provides a continuous view of the sunset.


## Bridal Veil Falls

miles: 2

route: round-trip

directions: Facing the valley at Morgan’s Steep, take the Perimeter Trail to your right. After two-tenths of a mile, cross a wooden bridge and turn left, following the Bridal Veil Falls Trail (white blazes) down the slope. The trail will intersect another trail; turn left to get to the waterfall. There’s 400 feet of elevation change on this trail.

description: The trail is an alternating series of steep slopes and flat benches leading off the plateau to a waterfall. The falls are spectacular, especially after a good rain. Other remarkable features along the way include large sandstone blocks and boulders that long ago broke away from the bluffs above and grapevines hanging from the trees. Look for this same setting on other trails that drop off the plateau such as Thumping Dick Cove, Shakerag Hollow, and the Old Cowan Road.  Bridal Veil Falls appears from the side of the mountain, cascades 27 feet down a limestone cliff, drops about 25 feet more, and then disappears into a sinkhole. Karst topography, man!
