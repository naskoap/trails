# Sewanee Trail Data

A collection of trail data for the Domain in various formats.

After editing, correcting, and enhancing the trail data provided by Sewanee's
[Landscape Analysis Lab](http://lal.sewanee.edu), we'd like to use it as the basis for a simple, interactive guide to publicly-accessible trails on the Domain.

This will give us a chance to explore the [Open Trails](http://www.opentraildata.org) specification and the newly-released [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/).
