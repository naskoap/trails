# Sewanee Trail Data

A collection of trail data for the Domain in various formats.

After editing, correcting, and enhancing the trail data provided by Sewanee's
Landscape Analysis Lab, we'd like to use it as the basis for a simple, interactive guide to publicly-accessible trails on the Domain.

This will give us a chance to explore the [Open Trails](http://www.opentraildata.org) specification and the newly-released [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/).
