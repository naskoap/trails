# Sewanee Trail Guide

Initial plan is to develop a simple, interactive guide to publicly-accessible trails on the Domain.

This will give us a chance to explore the [Open Trails](http://www.opentraildata.org) specification and the newly-released [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/).
